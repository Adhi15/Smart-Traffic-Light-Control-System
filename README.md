# Smart-Traffic-Light-Control-System

In India the traffic lights are either controlled manually or they have a specific timer that is default in every region or intersection. The signals donot account to the traffic and rather give more importance to time. Traffic being a major problem in India. Which is likely to affect the daily livelihood of people. Our project proposes althering the traffic light timer based on traffic in the particular lane rather than keeping a default timer.
